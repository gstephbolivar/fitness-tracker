## Description

As a user, I want to be able to view create and track daily workouts. 
I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.

## Usage

This [application](https://murmuring-castle-92228.herokuapp.com/) allows for a user to log their workout for the day. A user can create a new workout then add the exercise they are doing. If it is cardio, then they will say what form of cardio, the distance in miles, and the duration in minutes. If the user chooses resistance, then they will input the name, weight in pounds, sets, reps and duration in minutes. Then the user will add their exercise. The user may continue the workout at any time of that specific day. Next, the user can see dashboard to compare their fitness. 

## Contributing

A user can contribute to this website by making the UI friendlier and cleaning up the front end code.
